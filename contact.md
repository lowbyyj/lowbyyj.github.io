### So, you're looking for someone...

...who can learn your entire tech stack before their first coffee break? ☕️
- Let's just say I have a Ph.D. Mastering new things is kind of my superpower.

...with a constant stream of wild and fun game dev ideas? 🎮
- I'm a heavy gamer, which is just a fun way of saying I do "market research" constantly. My backlog of 'what-if' game concepts is probably bigger than my Steam library.

...who *actually* knows how to leverage AI? 🧠
- I’ve been prompting ChatGPT since November 2022—back when it was still an underground indie artist. Now I "vibe code" with AI for fun.

...or maybe you just want to be friends?
- Awesome! Nice to meet you! *(🤗—these days this emoji means something else, right?)*

### Drop me a line!

**Email:** yooyongjae@gmail.com
- Yep, that's my actual name. I know, pretty rare. I didn't have to battle seven other Yongjae Yoos in a tournament for it, but it feels like I should have.
